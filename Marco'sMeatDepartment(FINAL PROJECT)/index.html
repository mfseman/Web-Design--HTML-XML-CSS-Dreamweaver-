              <p>Welcome to my Meat Department! In my website, I will  inform you on five topics that you may find useful when purchasing meat. In the types of meats section,  I will inform you about the types of meats that are available at my market. The types of meat include the fat ratio or ingredients. In the How to cook section, I will teach you about how to grill your steaks the way that pleases you. For curiousity purposes, I implemented a Cost section so you know exactly how much the meat at my market cost. In the Origins section, I break down the cuts from the cow, pig, and chicken. I also elaberate on what meat comes out of each of those cuts. In the difference section, I will explain the differnet between the products that look similar, but are different. For any questions, feel free to contact me at: <a href="mailto:MarcsDepartment@mailinator.com.">MarcsDepartment@mailinator.com.</a></p>
