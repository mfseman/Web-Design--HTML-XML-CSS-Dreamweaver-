              <p>Our product prices are seasonally adjusted. We have different products that we sell during the winter, fall, and summer. You will see that some of the prices listed are not consistant throughout the year. Note that during the summer, the supply for grilling meats increases due to the high demand. During the winter, the majority of our goods sold are raw foods that you can either oven bake, or throw on a skillet. Therefore, in the winter, you will see the prices for foods which you can grill such as patties and steaks change throughout the year</p>
