<h1>Learning To Cook</h1>
<h2>A Good Skill</h2>
<p><img src="fruit.jpg" alt="A picture of a fruit" class="leftside">Cooking is a very good skill to acquire. If <a href ="start.html">You can cook</a>, 
you can eat well and hopefully not have to spend much money on your food. You can usually cook meals that are much healthier than what is found
in restaurants -- especially better than what is found in fast food restaurants.</p>

<h2>Can be Fun!</h2>

<p>Cooking can also be a lot of fun, and the process of cooking can be a fun social event that is shared with others, 
and of course the meals themselves are fun to share with others.</p>

<p><img src="crockPot.jpg" alt="crock pot" class="rightside"/>Crock Pot To cook, you need a kitchen, or at least some place to store food and utensils, and you need something to cook on or in. 
A refrigerator, even a small one, is highly recommended, as you will need a place to store both your raw ingredients and your cooked food. 
If you are just starting out, the least resource intensive device to cook with is a crock pot. 
A <a href="www.crock-pot.com">crock pot</a>. only takes about a foot of counter space and can be used to create a wide variety of meals.</p>
