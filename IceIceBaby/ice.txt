Treacherous Sidewalks

Home - Solutions

Winter can be a beautiful time of year in Michigan.  The skies are clean and crisp and sunlight glitters off fields of snow.  However, the roads can be dangerous for driving, and the sidewalks can be a dangerous place to walk.
Our neighborhood sidewalks are often covered with ice.  Some of the ice can be easy to see and walk around, but some of the ice is thin and it is impossible to know that it is there (until you suddenly find yourself hurtling to the ground). 
The ice is especially dangerous when walking downhill.
We have had several bad falls in our family, resulting in lots of injuries, including a broken shoulder and a broken leg.  So, we are now very good at taking precautionary measures.

Precautionary Measures

We now always make sure we do a couple of things when the world outside ices over.  We use a combination of salt and sand on our own sidewalks.  We always a large bucket on hand to spread around.

And for walking, we all have good boots.  A good tread is nice to have, but you are much safer if you have some kind of cleats on your boots.  The best we’ve found so far are these boots with removeable cleats:

The cleats can be pulled off when your walk into a store, which makes the store owners a lot happier.  No one has fallen with these cleats on.
